  "description": "Miroku-san, the slit-mouth woman, is to marry high school student Kouichi to maintain her existence as his
  family has been in charge of upkeeping superstitions for generations. To add, there seems to be another reason that he seems
  more than willing...

  Miroku, however, would rather use her own strength than borrow that of others. Thus, they establish a contract as follows.
  1. For a trial period of a year, they are to act as though they were married.
  2. If she is able to scare him within that year, the engagement will be broken.",
